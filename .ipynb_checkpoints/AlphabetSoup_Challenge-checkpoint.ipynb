    "### Background:\n",
    "From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received various amounts of funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* EIN and NAME—Identification columns\n",
    "* APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type\n",
    "* AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry\n",
    "* CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification\n",
    "* USE_CASE—Use case for funding\n",
    "* ORGANIZATION—Organization type\n",
    "* STATUS—Active status\n",
    "* INCOME_AMT—Income classification\n",
    "* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application\n",
    "* ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested\n",
    "* IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Objectives\n",
    "The goals of this challenge are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select, design, and train a binary classification model of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimize model training and input data to achieve desired model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "1. How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?"

    "Random forest model will be selected for comparison and to design optimal training parameters for the deep neural network due to it's robustness of obtaining reliable prediction from large datasets such as this one used for the assignment. "
